It is going to depend on what level of education you currently have and how thorough you want to be. When I started on this, I had little mathematical comprehension so most books were impossible for me to penetrate. Being 100% self-taught, and now I teach data structures and algorithms to people with no experience in it and many receive offers from the top tech companies. From that angle, there’s a certain subset that you need to know in practice vs the incredible depth taught in most books and schools.

If you don’t have a strong math background, I’d recommend these books. These were the ones that taught me what I need to know (and I have about 50 algorithm books on my shelf that were difficult to learn from — much more advanced than where I was, even for a first book in the subject). If I did it today, I’d go in numerical order (1 — 5 below):

Invitation to Computer Science 5th — cheaper than the 6th
Discovering Computer Science — an intro to computer science/programming but IMO, it sets a proper context about why we do computing as opposed to just learning to code or about algorithms
Data Structures using C (Thareja)— She is incredibly gifted in making things easy to learn
Algorithms 4th — Very practical
Then:

The Algorithm Design Manual
The following are really good alternatives or supplements (that I refer back to quite often) (not in any particular order)

Data Structures using C (Tenenbaum) — Older but incredibly insightful
Data Structures Made Easy — An okay book, very visual, I don’t care for the answer immediately after the question approach, but it is a good hands-on book aimed at interview prep for those with no experience with algorithms
Data Structures and ALGORITHMS in C++ 4th
Programming Challenges
Thinking Recursively in Java — A book purely focused on recursion
For more advanced or specialized data structures, I like the following books:

Algorithms and Data Structures — The Basic Toolbox — I actually just bought this book last week but I’m addicted to it.
Advanced Data Structures — Not a good 1st, 2nd, or 3rd book but its a good book once you’re ready to read it. I use it to strengthen my practice with graphs
Foundations of Algorithms 5th
Algorithms — Amazon reviewers complained about this book, but I found it enlightening and useful even before I understood what a good algorithm book is. I bought it for the algorithms on strings section
Handbook of Data Structures and Applications — I bought it only for the chapter on Amortized Analysis which I find 100x more illuminating than the dismal chapter about it in the CLRS book (that everyone else seems to copy if they even bring it up at all) (and CLRS isn’t on the list of books I recommend to self-learners)
As you venture closer to the theoretical, these books will be very enlightening:

How to Prove It 2nd — A gentle introduction to the math required for more rigorous learning
How to Think About Algorithms — Not Yet Another Algorithm book, rather this one teaches the proper mindset and how to think (correctly) when solving algorithms. I’m going through it now and learning a ton while correcting my approach about them
Analysis of Algorithms — An Active Learning Approach 2nd — a relatively applied approach to studying algorithms but not too impossible for a self-learner. Also going through this at the same time as the above, but far more casually
Outside of that, some other books I found particularly interesting and semi approachable

Mathematical Reasoning 2nd
For learning the math, I picked up (all) the books and solutions manual from:

http://artofproblemsolving.com
And:

Discrete Mathematics with Applications 4th — Don’t attempt it until you go through artofproblemsolving and how to prove it (links to both provided) or already have a strong background in math. These kinds of books are extremely difficult because you can’t get the solutions easily to check your understanding.
I own all the above books (and tons more). I’ve gone through some of them, and referenced others. I continue to go through them. The (first) #3 book by Thareja is really the only intro book you need. To learn them correctly (and how I teach it): learn to visualize how the structure looks in the computer memory and practice implementing them again and again and mixing and matching until it is second nature. For example, implement a vector (dynamic array) using arrays and doubly-linked lists when you get to it. Do it procedurally (pass the storage into it) and again using OOP where it’s contained in the object. Mix and match. Don’t just memorize.

Many of the books will implement a pseudocode of the algorithm then ask a lot of questions about the math behind it and it might leave you with the feeing you didn’t learn anything. That’s what I like about all the books I recommend above: they focus more on learning the algorithms then the math (and sometimes omit the math altogether). That’s a good enough approach to get through the interviews but maybe not your CS class.
