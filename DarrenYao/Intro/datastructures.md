" Datastructures are built in with functions such as (1) add, (2) remove, (3) size(), (4) isEmpty()

## Arrays
- Arrays.sort(arr) sorts static arrays
- Collections.sort(arr) sorts dynamic arrays
- O(n)


## Stacks
- LIFO
- push adds element on top of the stack
- pop removes element from bottom of stack
- peek retrieves element from top without removing it
- O(1)


## Queues
- FIFO
- add at back of queue
- poll deletes from back of queue
- peek retrieves element without deleting it
- Queues are only interfaces - use linkedlists
- O(1)


## Deques (pronounced "deck")
- addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, removeLast
- O(1)


## Priority Queues
- insertion, deletion, and retrieval of highest priority elements.
- O(log(n))
